    "AI can be broadly classified into two:  \n",
    "1)Narrow AI: This type of AI is also referred to as “weak AI”. Narrow AI usually carries out one particular task with extremely high efficiency which mimics human intelligence. An example would be any computer game where one player is the user and the other player is the computer.\n",
    "2)Strong AI: Also referred to as “general AI”. Here is where there is no difference between a machine and a human being. This is the kind of AI we see in the movies, the robots. "
